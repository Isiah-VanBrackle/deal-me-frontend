# Deal-me-Frontend

Deal-me is a single page web application designed to let users to open up new decks and deal the cards onto the page.

# Getting Started
To begin you'll want to clone down both this Frontend repository and the Backend. The instructions below will focus on getting the Frontend up and running.  I'd recommend you completely set up the Backend first to avoid a "server in use error."
* Note: There is a latency issue, I'd advise you to wait a bit after setting up the front and backends before clicking the <New Deck> or <Deal Cards> buttons to see the shuffled versions.

#Installing
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

this runs the app in the development mode.<br>
If you've already got the backend running it will say
* Something is already running on port 3000. Probably:
  puma 3.12.1 (tcp://localhost:3000) [deal-me]
and ask
* Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)
simply hit the <y> key and it will
* Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
